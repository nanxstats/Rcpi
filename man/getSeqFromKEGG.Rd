\title{Retrieve Protein Sequence from the KEGG Database}
\usage{
getSeqFromKEGG(id, parallel = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{A character vector, as the protein ID.}

\item{parallel}{An integer, the parallel parameter, indicates how many
process the user would like to use for retrieving
the data (using RCurl), default is \code{5}.
For regular cases, we recommend a number less than \code{20}.}
}
\value{
A list, each component contains one of the protein represented by
amino acid sequence(s).
